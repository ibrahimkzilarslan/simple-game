I coded a simple game with the help of Javascript.

It is a game that can fight artificial intelligence with this game.

There are 3 objects.Stone,paper,scissors...

The logic of the game is as follows: Stone breaks the scissors, scissors cuts the paper, paper covers the stone.

Click on any object to start the game.

          
          
                    GOOD LUCK :)
